Find answers to the following questions:
	•	Tell us a bit about the organism.
Salmon salar is an Atlantic salmon. It is found in the northern Atlantic Ocean and rivers connected to the ocean. This is a popular fish for human consumption.

	•	How many features does the file contain?
The file contains 622145 features.

	•	How many sequence regions (chromosomes) does the file contain? 
The file contains 4011 sequence regions.

	•	How many genes are listed for this organism?
The file contains 547772 genes(exon). 

	•	What are the top ten most annotated feature types (column 3) across the genome?
Only three feature types such as exon, mRNA, and sequence regions are listed.

	•	Having analyzed this GFF file, does it seem like a complete and well-annotated organism?
This GFF file provides details about the exons, mRNA, and sequence regions, which are important for understanding the coding regions of the genome. It lacks gene annotations, data on UTR, other types of RNA. Thus, the data set is not complete and not annotated.
