Chromosome AF086833.2 was the only reference sequence analyzed in this study. A total of 19 variants were identified in the sequence, with 17 single nucleotide variants (SNPs). No multiple nucleotide polymorphisms (MNPs) were observed. Additionally, there were 2 insertions, while all other types of variants, such as mixed variants, inversions, duplications, breakends, and intervals, were absent.

In the transition/transversion analysis, 23 transitions and 4 transversions were identified, resulting in a Ts/Tv ratio of 5.75. This high Ts/Tv ratio reflects the high genetic fidelity of the organism, as transitions are less disruptive to the DNA structure compared to transversions.
