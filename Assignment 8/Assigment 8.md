The original SAM file was 59 MB, which is reduced to a 14 MB BAM file. It was then sorted and further reduced to 11MB, resulting in almost an 81% reduction in size. This reduction in file size will help decrease data storage requirements and processing time, making data analysis faster.

198796 + 0 paired in sequencing
99398 + 0 read1
99398 + 0 read2
160708 + 0 properly paired (80.84% : N/A)
162666 + 0 with itself and mate mapped
1886 + 0 singletons (0.95% : N/A)
1122 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr
992 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr (mapQ>=5)
```

82.79% reads were sucessfully mapped to reference genome. This indicates that the reads are high quality sequencing data.
