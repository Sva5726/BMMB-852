## Stats of the alignment
```
199030 + 0 in total (QC-passed reads + QC-failed reads)
198796 + 0 primary
0 + 0 secondary
234 + 0 supplementary
0 + 0 duplicates
0 + 0 primary duplicates
164786 + 0 mapped (82.79% : N/A)
164552 + 0 primary mapped (82.77% : N/A)
198796 + 0 paired in sequencing
99398 + 0 read1
99398 + 0 read2
160708 + 0 properly paired (80.84% : N/A)
162666 + 0 with itself and mate mapped
1886 + 0 singletons (0.95% : N/A)
1122 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr
992 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr (mapQ>=5)
```

82.79% reads were sucessfully mapped to reference genome. This indicates that the reads are high quality sequencing data.
