## Observations 
The FASTQ file was 13 MB. After processing, it was reduced to 1.6 MB, which represents around an 87% reduction in size. Likewise, the original SAM file was 7.8 MB, which then reduced to 1.6 MB, resulting in almost an 80% reduction in size. This reduction in file size will help decrease data storage requirements and processing time, making data analysis faster.
